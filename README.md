# final-capstone-repo
Final capstone project for Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence


# Algorithmic Trading


## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
The objective of this project is to mirror the achievements of The Medallion Fund, a hedge fund under the management of Renaissance Technologies. Our primary focus is on identifying trade signals within the equity sector. The project's goal is to uncover predictive signals that can initiate trades. While there are no artificial intelligence systems capable of predicting future events, price discrepancies present us with an opportunity to profit from short-term price movements.


## DATA
This project will download market data from yahoo! finance (yfinance). This is a open souce library developed by Ran Aroussi which offers a threaded and Pythonic way to download market data from Yahoo!Finance.

## MODEL 
This project will utilize 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture patterns in time series data. While CNNs were originally designed for extracting meaningful information from images, they also have the potential to capture brief trading signals. As the project advances, we can explore the implementation of more sophisticated algorithms.


## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION
1.	Number of hidden layers and units
2.	Dropout
3.	Network weight initialisation
4.	Activation function
5.	Optimisation algorithm
6.	Learning rate
7.	Momentum
8.	Number of epochs
9.	Batch size

As CNNs has numeous parameters to optimise, ???

Description of which hyperparameters you have and how you chose to optimise them.
