# final-capstone-repo
Final capstone project for Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence


# Algorithmic Trading


## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
The objective of this project is to mirror the achievements of The Medallion Fund, a hedge fund under the management of Renaissance Technologies. Our primary focus is on identifying trade signals within the equity sector. The project's goal is to uncover predictive signals that can initiate trades. While there are no artificial intelligence systems capable of predicting future events, price discrepancies present us with an opportunity to profit from short-term price movements.


## DATA
This project will download market data from yahoo! finance (yfinance). This is a open souce library developed by Ran Aroussi which offers a threaded and Pythonic way to download market data from Yahoo!Finance.

## MODEL 
This project will utilize Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs) to predict the future from sequence of variable lengths. Due to the vanishing/exploding gradient problem from unrolling a large number of sequential, LSTM comes into play. As the project advances, we can explore the implementation of more sophisticated algorithms.


## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION
1.	Number of hidden layers and units
2.	Dropout
3.	Network weight initialisation
4.	Activation function
5.	Optimisation algorithm
6.	Learning rate
7.	Number of epochs
8.	Batch size
9.	and more...

Bayesian Optimisation with Hyperband (BOHB) will be used to optimise these hyperparameters.
